GOAL: be staticice_ , except for cameras.

.. _staticice: https://staticice.com.au/cgi-bin/search.cgi?q=4TB+NAS


Summary of proof-of-concept experiments:

* msy - a fully working scraper for MSY's parts list, complete with
  example output, and a Functional Requirements document.

  This like staticice_ *and* steamprices_ -- it remembers and charts
  price changes over time, so you can observe long-term trends!

  .. _steamprices: https://www.steamprices.com/au/app/70#history

  FIXME: I haven't cherry-picked msy into this repo yet!

* test2 - follow the scrapy_ tutorial, basic poking around scrapy ::

      cd test2 && scrapy crawl quotes

* test3 - work out how to make scrapy into a "normal" app.
  I couldn't quite reduce it to a single file, so ::

      python3 -m test3      # "run" the directory as-is

  Also worked out how to make scrapy save to a database (badly).

  Also work out how to turn the database able into an Excel
  spreadsheet (xlsx), for showing to regular people.

* test3-jb - because JB's sitemap has *ALL* products, not just cameras,
  I thought I'd ignore it and instead try to read from their
  user-facing pages like https://www.jbhifi.com.au/collections/cameras

  Big mistake - it's all generated by hairy javascript, so the only
  way to do that would be to either

  1. run an entire GUI browser in "headless" / "remote control" mode.
     requires like 2GB of RAM and 500MB of disk, and just really bad.

  2. reverse-engineer shopify's (deliberately confusing) javascript

  3. pretend to be a shopify retailer and dig through their
     (paywalled?) retailer docs, hoping it gives away something.

  So for now give up on that, and instead just read EVERY product, and
  throw away 98% of them (non-camera ones).

* test4.py - go back to doing scraping the "lo-fi" way, with no
  confusing OO middleware.  scrapy is *3 MEGABYTES* of code, we
  should be able to do this in about *0.04 MEGABYTES*.

  * Successfully scraping basic metadata from JB prodcts.
  * Add a quick hack to discard all the DVDs and CDs.
  * Add a quick hack to NEVER re-scrape any product.

* test5 - have a go at using scrapy's helper code *specifically
  designed* to deal with sitemap.xml.
